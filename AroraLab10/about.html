             <b>Who we are</b> <br>Philip Schechtman was born in 
             Florida and later moved to Asheville in his sophmore year of highschool. Likewise, David Fine was 
             born in Asheville and attended the same highschool as Philip. Here, their paths joined and their adventures started.
             When both attended UNC and then pledged to AEPi, they decided to partner up and find ways to earn some side cash. They began by 
             cleaning their own fraternity house and have since moved to clean other collegiate fraternities. Philip Schechtman has been 
             studying Computer Science and Econ, while David Schechtman has been studying Econ only. Both are dedicated and honest workers.

    <!-- ADD ALL YOUR CONTENT HERE, ABOVE THE <script> ELEMENTS BELOW. Don't forget to wrap everything in a .container or .container-fluid! After that: rows, columns, and content.  -->

    <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
